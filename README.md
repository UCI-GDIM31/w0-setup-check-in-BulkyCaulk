# GDIM 31 Fall 2024

This is the first GDIM31 assignment! This is not a test - just a way to make sure your computer setup is working for GitHub and to get some knowledge about your prior experience. There aren't correct answers for this so please do not be concerned about your grade when filling this out honestly!

## Introduction

1. I'm a junior year transfer student coming from Palomar College. That college didn't have much transferable courses for GDIM so I am taking most if not all undergrad courses required for the major. My favorite game has to be Super Metroid and as well as my favorite franchise/series. I also love the Alien franchise.
My pronouns are he/him and I'm fine with being called Marco. I'm taking the class because I hope one day I could build a metroidvania type game someday. I love metroidvanias and other types of games.


2. Which of the following best describes your major? Please specify if not GDIM.  

    - [X] Game Design & Interactive Media
    - [ ] Computer Science or related major (CS, CSE, Data Science, Informatics, etc) (please specify)
    - [ ] Art-related major (please specify)
    - [ ] Undecided
    - [ ] Other (please specify)

3. I want to learn how to make games and learn more about the industry, mainly what tools they use and how to use them. 

4. I'm nervous about making groups, but in time I will be fine. I'm more excited about projects than I am nervous about them.

## Prior Experience

The next questions ask about what (if any) prior experience you have. This class assumes students have no prior knowledge, so don’t worry if you have 0 experience programming or with game development! Just write 0 or N/A under the headers. These questions are JUST for us to get an overall picture of the class's experience level so that we can make sure to be meeting you all where you are.

### Development

1. Programming (any languages/ frameworks)
    - I have some knowledge in Python, Java, and C. These were used for some of the classes I took at Palomar College
    - I studied a little bit of C++ and C#, but they are still new to mew
      
2. Game development (any engine)
    N/A

3. Unity
    N/A

### Programming & Game Development Concepts

For the next questions, a programming or game development concept is presented:

 - If you are NOT familiar with this topic, write N/A.
 - If you ARE familiar with this concept, do your best to define it in your own words.

**These questions are not graded for accuracy! Answer honestly, don’t Google it.**

1. Game design document
    N/A
2. Scope management
    N/A
3. Iteration
    When a program/chunk of code runs it will usually run only once, with iteration we can have it run until however long we want.
4. Object-Oriented programming
    A way to store multiple attributes to certain objects.
5. Model-View-Controller architecture
    N/A
